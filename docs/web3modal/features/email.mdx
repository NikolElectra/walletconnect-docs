# Web3Modal Email Wallets

Web3Modal SDK enables passwordless Web3 onboarding (no seed phrases) and authentication.
It offers blazing-fast, hardware-secured, passwordless login, Web3 onboarding, and access to over 20 blockchains with a few lines of code â€” even if you have an existing auth solution.

## Process Overview

Connecting with Web3Modal's Email Wallet is a simple and secure process for both new and existing users. It allows users to sign in with their email address via a One Time Password (OTP) sent to their email.

### User enters email

User opens Web3Modal and enters their email address.

### Email with OTP sent

If the user is not already registered or signing in from a new device, an email is sent with a link to approve login.
An email is sent to the user's email address with a One Time Password.

## Migrating to Self Custody

Users can easily migrate to self custody solution in a few clicks. This allows users to take full control of their account and assets.

### Upgrade your wallet

User clicks "Upgrade your wallet" in the modal to start the migration process.

### WalletConnect Secure

User is redirected to [WalletConnect Secure](https://secure.walletconnect.com/dashboard) to complete the migration process.

<img className="image-margin" src={useBaseUrl('/img/w3m/email/5.png')} />

### Migrate to Self Custody

Once they are redirected to WalletConnect Secure, the user can migrate to a self custody solution.
This process can be divided into 3 steps:

1. Connect your new wallet
2. Export your recovery phrase
3. Import it into your new wallet

Upon completion, they have successfully migrated to a self custody solution.

:::info Note

The user can still use their email to login with Web3Modal, but now they have full control of their account and assets.
