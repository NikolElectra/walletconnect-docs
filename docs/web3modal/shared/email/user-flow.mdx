1. Users will be able to connect to you application by simply using an email address. Web3Modal will send to them a One Time Password (OTP) to copy and paste in the modal, which will help to
   verify the user's authenticity. This will create a non-custodial wallet for your user which will be available in any application that integrates Web3Modal and email login.

2. Eventually the user can optionally choose to move from a non-custodial wallet to a self-custodial one by pressing "Upgrade Wallet" on Web3Modal.
   This will open the _([WalletConnect secure website](https://secure.walletconnect.com/dashboard))_ that will walk your user through the upgrading process.
